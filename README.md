# Javascript-Scraper
 Simple scraper in Javascript

====================================================

I built this purely to help me with another project, but figured I would put it on here, so if anyone is interested they could give me some tips, advice or feedback to get this to be dynamic.

This scraper was built to extract the information I needed from a particular website:
"www.lifeisfeudal.com"

It can be modified to use on other sites, I would like it to become dynamic at some point.

====================================================

I have got it to work on a server in headless mode.

You will need to input login details in the assets/settings.json file (Seen here as sample/settings, Just rename it).

File directories will need to be modified for your setup.

You will need to install puppeteer.js and cheerio.js for this to work.

Have fun!
