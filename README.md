# Javascript-Scraper
 Simple scraper in Javascript

====================================================
I built this purely to help me with another project, but figured I would put on here, so if anyone is interested they could give me some tips to get this to be dynamic.

Any tips, advice or feedback is much appreciated.

This scraper was built to extract the information I needed from a particular website:

"https:\\www.lifeisfeudal.com"

However can be modified to use on other sites, I would like it to become dynamic at some point.
